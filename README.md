# Dart-Project
Capstone Project Dart App   


Dart is a mobile application designed to digitalize Moroccan tontines (also called Dart) by streamlining the process of managing rounds, participants, and payments. This app is built using the PER-Native stack, comprising PostgreSQL, Express, React Native, and Node.js.   
Features:  
  
- User registration and authentication  
  
- Creation and management of tontine rounds  
  
- Adding and managing participants in a round  
  
- Viewing and updating user profiles  
  
- Secure storage of user passwords and RIBs  

  
## Getting Started:  
  
These instructions will help you run the project on your local machine for testing purposes.
